MS SEG challenge pre-processed training dataset

Version 2

Corrects registration errors between modalities for some patients.

----------

Version 1

This file contains the pre-processed images for the 15 patients of the challenge training dataset. These patients are coming from three different MRI scanners located in three different centers (see https://portal.fli-iam.irisa.fr/msseg-challenge/data for more details on the centers and scanners). Patients starting with 01 come from a Siemens 3T Verio scanner, those starting with 07 from a Siemens Aera 1.5T scanner, and finally those starting with 08 from a Philips Ingenia 3T scanner.

The provided images include, for each patient:

- 3D FLAIR image
- 3D T1 image
- T2 image
- DP image
- 3D T1 Gd image (post-contrast agent image)

Manual segmentations may be found in the unprocessed dataset. The following pre-processing was applied for each patient:

- denoising with the NL-means algorithm [1] of each image
- rigid registration [2] of each image towards the FLAIR image 
- Brain extraction using the volBrain platform [3] from the T1 image and applied on the other modalities with sinc interpolation
- Bias correction using the N4 algorithm [4]

For any question or remark on the images provided, please contact challenges-iam@inria.fr.
